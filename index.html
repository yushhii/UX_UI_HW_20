            <p class="body">Before proceeding to our research, we had brainstormed and used dot voting to finalize we would focus on solving the frustration of someone moving cities/countries as we felt planning a move was a tedious process.  However, we soon discovered through quantitative research there was a bigger more consistent problem that people moving to new areas faced.</p>

            <p class="body">This issue was more prominent in their lives, they were more passionate about it and felt the hardest part of moving was lack of meaningful relationships in their life which made them feel helpless and lonely.
